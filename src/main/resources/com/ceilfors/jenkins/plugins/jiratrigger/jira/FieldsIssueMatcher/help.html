  <p>
    When a Jira webhook event arrives, the event body (JSON data) contains details of an issue, including the fields.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fields can be used to match against this configuration like this:
  </p>

  <ol class="org-ol">
    <li><p>
        You specify the FIELD NAME and the expected FIELD VALUE here
      </p>

      <p>
        We choose FIELD NAMES over FIELD IDS, because
      </p>

      <ul class="org-ul">
        <li>Ids like <code>customfield_11523</code> doesn't make much sense to human beings</li>
        <li><p>
            Ids are not portable over test environment and production environment
          </p>

          <p>
            It's very likely for the fields that server the same purpose on both Test Jira and Production Jira to have the same FIELD NAMEs but not the same FIELD IDs.
        </p></li>
    </ul></li>

    <li><p>
        The FIELD NAME you specified will be calculated to the FIELD ID, all there are saved:
      </p>
      <ul class="org-ul">
        <li>FIELD NAME</li>
        <li>FIELD ID</li>
        <li>expected FIELD VALUE</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Note that you need to make sure the field names and ids of your Jira server is 1-on-1. It's undefined to have 2 fields with different ids but the same name.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
        When webhook event fires, the fields of the issue will be compared the the saved FIELD ID and FIELD VALUE (webhook event does not contain field names).
      </p>

      <p>
        For a field to match, it must satisfy both:
      </p>

      <ul class="org-ul">
        <li>Its field id is equal to the saved FIELD ID</li>
        <li><p>
            Its field value is <i>equal</i> to the saved FIELD VALUE
          </p>

        </p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If no matching field can be found, then the job is not scheduled.
    </p></li>
  </ol>
